Phase 1: Visual Foundation - Strategic Breakdown
1. 3D Resource Models (Blender ‚Üí Godot Pipeline)
Zappy Resources to Model:

nourriture (food) - Maybe breadcrumbs, fruits, or abstract food shapes
linemate - Crystal/mineral formations
deraumere - Different crystal type
sibur - Organic/plant-like resources
mendiane - Metallic ores
phiras - Glowing/energy crystals
thystame - Rare/magical looking resources
Technical Considerations:

Low-poly aesthetic works well with risograph style
Consistent scale across all resources
Modular approach - create base shapes, vary colors/materials
LOD versions for performance (though not critical yet)
Export as .glb/.gltf for best Godot compatibility
2. Camera Controller Enhancement
Current Priority Features:

Orbit controls around map center
Smooth zoom with min/max limits
Edge panning when mouse reaches screen edges
Reset to overview with spacebar/home key
Smooth interpolation for all movements
Risograph-Friendly Camera:

Slightly tilted angle (not top-down) for depth
Fixed perspective rather than orthographic for that printed feel
Subtle camera shake on certain events for tactile feedback
3. Risograph Visual Identity - Smart Approach
Material Strategy:

Limited color palette (4-6 main colors like real risograph)
Flat shading with subtle gradients
Paper texture overlay on materials
High contrast between elements
Noise/grain effects for authentic print feel
Tile Material System:

Player Visual Design:

Simple geometric shapes (cylinders, capsules)
Bold team colors with risograph-style color separation
Directional indicators (simple arrows/cones)
4. Height Randomizer System - Elegant Solution
Heat Point Algorithm:

Visual Enhancement Ideas:

Gentle slopes and plateaus rather than sharp peaks
Consistent lighting so height doesn't affect gameplay visibility
Ramp/stair visual indicators where height changes significantly
Color tinting based on elevation (lighter = higher)
üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Strategy
Week 1: Resource Models & Import
Model 2-3 key resources in Blender first (test pipeline)
Establish art style and proportions
Set up import workflow and material assignments
Test performance with multiple instances
Week 2: Camera System
Implement orbit controls (most important for navigation)
Add zoom constraints
Smooth interpolation for professional feel
Test with different map sizes
Week 3: Visual Identity
Create risograph material shader in Godot
Design tile material system with resource overlays
Player visual design and team differentiation
Lighting setup for consistent aesthetic
Week 4: Height System
Implement heat point algorithm
Add visual transitions (ramps/stairs)
Test with existing tile system
Performance optimization
üé® Risograph Style Technical Notes
Shader Considerations:
Posterization for limited color bands
Halftone patterns for shadows/highlights
Color separation effects
Paper texture as overlay
Color Palette Strategy:
Primary team colors + neutral base colors
High contrast combinations
Consistent saturation levels across all elements
Performance Balance:
Stylized approach can actually be more performant
Fewer texture details needed
Simple lighting model
üîÑ Integration with Existing System
Minimal Changes Needed:
Your current tile positioning system works perfectly
Resource visualization just needs model swapping
Player manager can easily handle new player models
Material system can layer over existing logic
Future-Proof Considerations:
Modular resource system - easy to add new types
Scalable height system - works with any map size
Flexible material system - can switch styles later
üéØ Success Metrics for This Phase
Visual Cohesion - Everything feels like one consistent art style
Navigation Comfort - Camera feels intuitive and smooth
Resource Clarity - Easy to distinguish different resource types
Performance Stability - No frame drops with enhanced visuals
Height Integration - Elevation enhances without confusing
